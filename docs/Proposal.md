### Problem Statement: 
Today, Christians have the opportunity to deliver the Word in a more effective, convenient, and personalized way with modern technologies, such as Google Chrome extensions. However, the majority of existing Bible verse extensions often fall short of expectations due to outdated browsers, generic backgrounds, lack of Biblical versions, and lack of customization options. This ultimately results in a clunky and unsatisfactory user experience. The key solution to this issue is to provide users with greater customizability in a variety of fields. Doing this will give Christians a more satisfying and immersive experience with Scripture, resulting in better engagement and understanding overall. This project seeks to create a superior Bible verse extension for Google Chrome, allowing fellow Christians to move forward with modern opportunities to spread the Word effectively.

### Project Description: <br/>
This project will be a highly customizable Google Chrome extension for displaying Bible verses on new browser tabs. The customization options will include the user's preferred search bar browser, background image/style, verse window location, Bible version, and the verses themselves. The default browser will be Google Chrome, but other commonly used browsers will be available for users to choose from. The background of the new tab will be minimalistic by default with a light or dark mode. However, users will be able to choose their own custom background image.
Users will be able to choose which Bible version they would prefer, selecting from the choices available on Bible Gateway. Also from Bible Gateway, there will be their default "Verse of the Day." Users can also choose the verse displayed for themselves or have it display a random verse daily. The appearance of the verse window will also be customizable to the user, including custom color and font options. They can also choose from preset locations for the verse window to be on the screen, or they can freely select their own, allowing users to adapt it perfectly according to whatever custom background image they choose.

<!--I considered the option of music to play in the background while on the new tab, but I suspect that this would cause a number of internal issues. For now, I'm not planning on adding, but if I do, it will be minimal and out of scope here.-->

<!--In the future (beyond the scope of the project I plan to do here), I may also implement the daily of verses to be read in the Orthodox faith. Or, perhaps, this will evolve into a different edition of the extension entirely due to the calendar nature and larger quantity of daily readings in Orthodoxy.-->

### Proposed Implementation Language(s):<br/>
This proposed Google Chrome extension will require the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programming languages. These languages will all be necessary because this extension will interact with the functionality and visual design of the browser. <br/>
HTML will be used as a content markup language to structure and organize the extension's content. CSS will be utilized for the visual styling, a major driving reason for my plan for this Chrome extension. Javascript will be used for the scripting logic and functioning of the extension.

### Libraries, Packages, and Development Kits: <br/>
The project will use the Google Chrome Developer Tools and its "Getting Started Guides" to provide basic instructions and examples of Chrome extension segments. In addition, I will utilize the "Chrome extension source viewer" to compare and contrast the code with other extensions. Specifically, this will allow me to identify shortcomings in the other Bible extensions, as well as my own, and I will be able to explore the best practices. <br/>
One major library the project will incorporate includes the jQuery Javascript library. It allows for easy HTML document traversal and manipulation, as well as the Bible API, which will be used to retrieve Bible verses and other relevant data.

### Additional Software/Equipment Needed: <br/>
The project will only require minimal equipment and software, all of which I already have.<br/>
It will need a computer with Internet access and sufficient processing power, memory, and storage to handle the software. <br/>
The Google Chrome browser is the target platform for this project; therefore, it is a requirement for the project development and testing. <br>
An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) will be needed to compose the project in the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript languages. In my case, I will be using Visual Studio Code.

### Personal Motivation: <br/>
This project will allow me to further my knowledge and skills in the field of computer science. As the first real project that I will be undertaking independently and with few strict guidelines, it will provide me a greater chance to exercise my decision-making and self-pacing skills than in previous projects. With the project I have planned out, I will gain personal experience in developing Google Chrome extensions - a topic I have no prior knowledge of when it comes to programming. By the end of the project, I will have aquired valuable skills in this area that will further allow me to develop more Chrome extensions in the future. This, in turn, will contribute to my growth as a programmer in general.

### Outline of Future Research Efforts: <br/>
The following outline lists all that I must learn how to implement in order to achieve the full scope of functionality for my Google Chrome extension. In summary, it includes fetching various Bible features from Bible Gateway, creating user-friendly customizing options for the UI, and adjusting for different screen sizes and resolutions.
<br/>

- how to access and use the Google Chrome API

- how to add an extension to the Chrome Web Store
- how to use fetch and display verses from Bible Gateway
- how to narrow fetches from Bible Gateway to different Bible versions
- how to store user preferences using Chrome storage API
- how to implement basic light and dark modes
- how to allow users to upload their own image as the background
- how to implement custom font styles and colors
- how to create UI for different screen sizes and resolutions
- how to allow for preset locations and user-selected locations for the verse's text box
- how to create the verse randomizer to avoid repeats
- how to create an additional UI for custom Bible verse selection
- how to handle errors and exceptions (and how to register such with users)
- how to optimize extension performance and memory usage

#### Solutions:
I plan to identify solutions to these challenge through Google's official documentation and tutorials with supplementary YouTube videos and online forums, if needed.

#### Deliverables:
- Minimal Viable Product ("Order of Things") Deliverable
- Final Product Deliverable
