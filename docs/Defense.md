## 1 - Statement of Purpose/Problem Statement <a id="section1"></a>
Today, Christians have the opportunity to deliver the Word in a more effective, convenient, and personalized way with modern technologies, such as Google Chrome extensions. However, the majority of existing Bible verse extensions often fall short of expectations due to outdated browsers, generic backgrounds, lack of Biblical versions, and lack of customization options. This ultimately results in a clunky and unsatisfactory user experience. The key solution to this issue is to provide users with greater customizability in a variety of fields. Doing this will give Christians a more satisfying and immersive experience with Scripture, resulting in better engagement and understanding overall. This project seeks to create a superior Bible verse extension for Google Chrome, allowing fellow Christians to move forward with modern opportunities to spread the Word effectively.
<br/><br/>

## 2 - Research and Background <a id="section2"></a>
(NF???)
(all the things I needed to figure out – describing what I had to learn / what would you need to learn PRIOR to understanding how project works or how to make project)
<br/>
(just do my best to recall)
<br/>
(varied length could be 1 page, could be 3-4 pages)
<br/><br/>
[
To build my Chrome Extension, I encountered a wide range of tasks and challenges, each requiring different skills and knowledge. Here's a comprehensive list of what I’ve needed to learn and figure out:
<br/>
1. **HTML and CSS**: Knowing HTML and CSS is necessary for designing the user interface of my extension. I’ve needed to create popup pages, options pages, and other UI elements using HTML and style them using CSS to ensure a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
2. **JavaScript Fundamentals**: Understanding the basics of JavaScript is crucial as it's the primary language for building Chrome Extensions. I’ve needed to learn about variables, functions, loops, conditionals, and other fundamental concepts.
3. **Chrome Extension Architecture**: Familiarizing myself with the architecture of Chrome Extensions, including background scripts, content scripts, popup pages, and options pages, is essential. I’ve needed to understand how these components interact and communicate with each other.
4. **DOM Manipulation**: Understanding how to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript is essential for dynamically updating the UI of my extension based on user interactions or other events.
5. **Asynchronous JavaScript**: Dealing with asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from external sources or performing actions in the background, requires a good understanding of asynchronous JavaScript programming using promises, async/await, or callbacks.
6. **Chrome Extension APIs**: Chrome provides a set of APIs that allow extensions to interact with browser features and functionality. I’ve needed to learn about these APIs and how to use them for tasks such as storage, tabs, messaging, and notifications.
7. **Event Handling**: Handling user interactions and browser events effectively is crucial for providing a smooth user experience. I’ve needed to learn how to capture and handle events such as clicks, input changes, keyboard events, and page loads.
8. **Data Storage**: Storing user preferences, extension settings, or other data locally or remotely requires knowledge of different storage mechanisms such as Chrome storage, local storage, or external databases.
9. **Error Handling and Debugging**: Knowing how to handle errors gracefully and debug issues effectively is essential for troubleshooting and improving the quality of my extension. I’ve needed to learn about debugging tools, console logging, and error handling techniques.
10. **Security Best Practices**: Understanding security best practices for Chrome Extensions is crucial to prevent security vulnerabilities and protect user data. I’ve needed to learn about permissions, content security policies, and secure communication practices.
11. **Deployment and Publishing**: Understanding the process of packaging, deploying, and publishing my extension to the Chrome Web Store is essential for making my extension available to users. I’ve needed to learn about packaging requirements, publishing guidelines, and submission processes.
Overall, building a Chrome Extension involves a diverse set of skills and knowledge areas, including programming, web development, user interface design, testing, and deployment. By mastering these areas, I can create a high-quality and successful extension that meets the needs of my users.

(Priority Scale - 1 is the highest, 5 is the lowest.)

----

<p>
ID Number: 1
</p>
<p>
Type: Functional
</p>
<p>
Description:<br/>
&emsp; The extension will display a Bible verse on the new tab page. This will be implemented from the website Bible Gateway. 
</p>
<p>
Rationale:<br/>
&emsp; This is the main functionality of the extension, and it will serve the purpose of providing the user with a Bible verse.
</p>
<p>
Fit Criterion:<br/>
&emsp; A Bible verse is displayed on the new tab page - yes or no.
</p>
<p>
Priority: 1
</p>
<p>
Dependencies: N/A
</p>

----

> Requirement 2: Future Implementation <br/>
> The search bar feature was deemed unnecessary at-launch with the URL search still available. However, the feature is open for future implementation, especially with enough user feedback.
<s>
<p>
ID Number: 2
</p>
<p>
Type: Functional
</p>
<p>
Description:<br/>
&emsp; The extension's search bar will sync with their default browser. 
</p>
<p>
Rationale:<br/>
&emsp; There are Google extensions that allow for the use of a different search engine while within Google Chrome (i.e. Duckduckgo). Maintaining this user preference will increase the extension's appeal. Not providing this feature would be a downgrade in the minds of a significant number of users. 
</p>
<p>
Fit Criterion:<br/>
&emsp; Users can choose their preferred browser for the search bar in an options menu.
</p>
<p>
Priority: 2

Type: Functional
</p>
<p>
Description:<br/>
&emsp; The extension will allow users to choose their own background image or style. 
</p>
<p>
Rationale:<br/>
&emsp; Customization is a key aspect of the extension, and allowing users to choose their own background image or style will make the extension more personal. 
</p>

<p>
Description:<br/>
&emsp; The extension will allow users to choose their preferred version of the Bible. 
</p>
<p>
Rationale:<br/>
&emsp; Customization is a key aspect of the extension, and users may have a preferred version of the Bible to read. Giving them the option to choose it will increase the extension's appeal.
</p>
<p>
Fit Criterion:<br/>
&emsp; Users can choose their preferred Bible version in an options menu.
</p>
<p>

----

<p>
ID Number: 6
</p>
<p>
Type: Functional
</p>
<p>
Description:<br/>
&emsp; The extension will display the "Verse of the Day" from Bible Gateway by default. 
</p>
<p>
Rationale:<br/>
&emsp; Displaying the "Verse of the Day" will provide users with a daily Bible verse without requiring any action on their part. This will allow for users to reflect upon the same verses as others, read verses relevant to the Christian calendar, and generally aid those lacking motivation or technical literacy to select the verses themselves.
</p>
<p>
Fit Criterion:<br/>
&emsp; The "Verse of the Day" is displayed by default as the Bible verse on the new tab page. 
</p>
<p>
Priority: 1
</p>
<p>
Dependencies: 1  
</p>

----
> Requirement 7: Future Implementation <br/>
> Implementing Bible Gateway's Verse of the Day was determined as viable enough for a "random" verse. Furthermore, with the addition of user-selected verses, one may independently randomize their Bible verse. However, there *was* some user interest in implementing this feature. Thus, I plan to do so in the future.
<s>
<p>
ID Number: 7
</p>
<p>
Type: Functional
</p>
<p>
Description:<br/>
&emsp; The extension will allow users to choose a random Bible verse to display on the new tab page. To clarify, this random verse would be cycled daily, not any time a new tab is opened. This selection will also be purely random, even allowing repeated verses on consecutive days. All of Scripture is God's Word.
</p>
<p>
Rationale:<br/>
&emsp; Allowing users to receive a random Bible verse will provide them with an alternative series of verses throughout their use of the extension. Some users may prefer this in reading their Scripture.
</p>
<p>
Fit Criterion:<br/>
&emsp; Users can choose for a random Bible verse to display on the new tab page in an options menu.

<p>
Description:<br/>
&emsp; The extension will allow users to choose their own custom verse to display on the new tab page. 
</p>
<p>
Rationale:<br/>
&emsp; Allowing users to choose their own custom verse will provide them with a personalized experience and may be useful for memorization or meditation and study. 
</p>
<p>
Fit Criterion:<br/>
&emsp; Users can choose their own custom verse to display on the new tab page in an options menu. This will be the primary alternate choice of Bible verse.

ID Number: 9
</p>
<p>
Type: Look and Feel - Appearance
</p>
<p>
Description:<br/>
&emsp; The extension's default background on the new tab page will be minimalistic with a light or dark mode.
</p>
<p>
Rationale:<br/>
&emsp; A minimalistic background will provide a clean and unobtrusive look for the extension, while the light/dark option will accentuate that look depending on which a user prefers. In addition, allowing users to choose between the two will allow for a simple binary choice and a clean canvas for those seeking more customization.
</p>
<p>
Fit Criterion:<br/>
&emsp; The default background will be minimalistic, and there will be an option for light or dark mode in an options menu. Whether these backgrounds are suitable will be decided by survey. It will be accepted if surveyors, on a scale of 1 to 5, rate it a 4 on average.

</p>
<p>
Description:<br/>
&emsp; The extension will allow users to easily share Bible verses via social media.
</p>
<p>
Rationale:<br/>
&emsp; Sharing Bible verses is a common practice among Christians, and social media is a popular platform for doing so.
</p>
<p>
Fit Criterion:<br/>
&emsp; The user should be able to share a Bible verse to their social media account with a few clicks.

</p>
<p>
Rationale:<br/>
&emsp; Users expect extensions to load quickly and not interfere with their browsing experience. 
</p>
<p>
Fit Criterion:<br/>
&emsp; The extension should load within 100 milliseconds (1/10 of a second) of the user opening a new tab. (This is under the assumption that the user has selected an extremely high definition background.)

Description:<br/>
&emsp; The extension will be lightweight and not consume excessive system resources. 
</p>
<p>
Rationale:<br/>
&emsp; Users expect extensions to be lightweight and not consume too much memory or CPU resources. Google Chrome, even with a single tab open, consumes a large amount of memory. Making the extension casually useable is almost as important making it functional.
</p>
<p>
Fit Criterion:<br/>

<p>
Rationale:<br/>
&emsp; Users may find visual elements such as extensive customizing menus as distracting or unnecessary. At the same time, these menus will still remain at short reach while in the Extensions section.

## 5 - Project Implementation <a id="section5"></a>
(NF???)
(can say/describe(?) design and features, explain how you wrote it (high-level, little detail(?)), how submitted to Chrome Web Store (deployment) ) 
<br/>
<br/><br/>
The Bible Verse Vista extension aims to replace the normal new tab with a page that displays Bible verses, but I wanted to distinguish it from other similar extensions that are often extremely limited or bland with how they execute it. However, I also know that not everybody is meticulous or extreme in their desire to customize. As such, my extension was specifically designed with the idea of pairing simplicity with high customizability - to cater to all followers of Christ so they may imbue more of God's Word in their daily online activities in a way that suits them personally.<br/>
<br/>
Key features include the ability to choose between automatic or manual selection of daily verses, select from a variety of Bible versions available on Bible Gateway, and customize the background image or color of new tabs. Users can also customize the appearance of the verse window, including the font, color, and size of the text. Additionally, the extension offers light and dark mode options to suit different preferences.<br/>
<br/>
I did this by utilizing three languages - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - the basics for building webpages. HTML creates the structure of the webpage and all its elements, CSS deals with the visuals of all those elements, and JavaScript deals with the interactive features on the webpage, connections to Bible Gateway, and how all the settings are saved and synced.<br/>
<br/>
One way to start showing the implementation is to show how I like to have my own new tab customized. Here is also what my settings sidebar looks like - just very basic HTML and CSS used to show and hide it from the screen.<br/>
![SS my page](ss/SS-mine.png) ![SS settings sidebar](ss/SS-mine-settings.png)
<br/><br/>
I will go through how I got to this level of customization, but first, I want to show an important feature. Here in the settings page, I have implemented buttons for "Save User Settings", "Return to Defaults", and "Load User Settings". After pressing the save button, I can return to these settings at any time by pressing load. Also saved are the default settings, which can be returned to at any time.<br/>
![SS Default/Save/Load buttons](ss/SS-mine-saves.png) ![SS default page](ss/SS-default.png)
<br/><br/>
This is the page I'll be starting from to demonstrate the present key features of Bible Verse Vista. However, I can reload my saved settings from before, as I stated previously. All of this was possible thanks to JavaScripts saving features that can store the many values for the default page and a user-preferred page (and return to either at any time).<br/>
![SS reloaded page](ss/SS-mine.png)
<br/><br/>
Anyways, back to the rest of the main features, we can see that the default page is very basic. Not quite a blank slate, but very close, and that was my intent. This allows users to let their creativity find what they best prefer. From the basics, we see the Verse of the Day, the Bible Version, and the Theme.<br/>
There are three themes: Light Mode, Dark Mode, and User Mode. User Mode basically starts in Light Mode, and I wanted to separate the User Mode from it so that Light Mode could be easily set and returned to at any time. Not all users want to go through each element they are able to color, including myself. For my own sake, I simply set mine to dark mode. However, to show the full breadth of the features, I will keep it in User Mode.<br/>
![SS default settings](ss/SS-default.png)
<br/><br/>
Pulling from Bible Gateway's website via Javascript allows me to use their Automatic Verse of the Day code, but I also manually coded a way to access any verse(s) from their website. This gives the users their own choice of verse at any time so long as they type the book, chapter, and verse(s). Notice how it now isn't the same as the automatic verse from before.
![SS User Choice VotD](ss/SS-verse.png)
<br/><br/>
The same can be done with the Bible Version, which also categorizes it by language, which I access from Bible Gateway by storing each url section in JavaScript.
![SS new Bible version](ss/SS-langs.png) ![SS new Bible version and language](ss/SS-langs2.png)
<br/><br/>
Now, let's pick up the pace and look at the wide variety of features available. You can customize the main background - choices of images or any color you like, the verse window, the window's border, the header, the text of the verse itself, and event the elements of the settings sidebar itself!
![SS settings page pic](ss/SS-settings1.png) ![SS settings page pics](ss/SS-settings2.png)
<br/><br/>
Here, I'll demonstrate some possibilities to customize and explain what I changed.<br/>

And to top it all off, even after all the changes I've made, I can return back to how I best like my Bible Verse Vista page!<br/>

For my last step of my implementation, I had to prepare and upload my extension to the Chrome Web Store for their approval. This involved a number of things, including (NF???).<br/>

## 6 - Test Plan <a id="section6"></a>
### 6.1 - Introduction <a id="section6-1"></a>
#### 6.1.1 - Project Overview <a id="section6-1-1"></a>
This document outlines the testing strategy and approach for the development of this Google Chrome extension that creates highly customizable new tabs to display Bible verses. While a number of extensions exist that display verses on new tabs, many are extremely bland and static, lacking any customization options. This extension aims to create a more effective, convenient, and personalized way to deliver the Word to any user.
#### 6.1.2 - Goals/Objectives <a id="section6-1-2"></a>
- Validate the functionality and customization options of the Bible verses and the New Tab for the extension
- Ensure extension compatibility within the Chrome browser framework
- Ensure that the extension and its customization is satisfying and easy-to-use, receiving feedback from a variety of users
- Measure and minimize load for best performance – stability even with a large number of new tabs
#### 6.1.3 - Constraints <a id="section6-1-3"></a>
-	There was a limited time to work before milestones and due dates, including the final submission.
-	This was a one-man project – I am the only developer and test manager.
-	I have had multiple ongoing courses with weekly projects of their own, which required split attention with this project.
-	Due to critical issues regarding my usual workspace, I had to work within a limited environment on another laptop. This negatively affected the development and testing time. Thankfully, this would soon even out as the system become more aclimated to my workload.

	- Designed with clarity and intuitive settings for the sake of users inexperienced with my extensions, with using extensions, or with using technology, in general. (12)
		- (For any messages, ensure that the tone is representative of Christ)
		- (Make sure that users are not pressured by all the options - make it clear that there are easy presets and wider choice beyond that is up to them)
- Errors
	- Avoid errors, obviously (16, 22)
	- Display errors to users - informative, but not too informative
#### 6.3.3 - Test Approach <a id="section6-3-3"></a>
-	My overall approach to testing was primarily manual testing. The presets, user settings, and the Bible Gateway sync were easy to test. The many other customization features were testing extremes, many of which were often be implemented on purpose and allowed for the sake of user customization. (Regardless of aesthetic appeal or “normal” sensibility – user choice is the priority.)
  -	As the sole developer, all the extensive testing performed by myself was white box testing.
  -	As for anyone else tested, they performed black box testing. This approximated how users would receive it from the Chrome Web Store, testing whether the extension itself was intuitive enough to use effectively.
-	There was no plan for automatic testing.
-	The types of tests that were performed are unit tests, integration tests, system tests, and user acceptance tests (UATs).
##### 6.3.3.1 - System Test <a id="section6-3-3-1"></a>
-	This testing ensured that Bible Gateway was synced properly and that each customization setting within a new tab was properly implemented – default, other presets, and user-chosen – in an individual sense and all together.
-	It also verified if the settings are maintained across many new tabs and tests whether settings save or not upon webpage refresh, extension on/off, browser on/off, post-shutdown, etc.
-	Is it displaying each and all of the features as expected? 
  -	[ Yes or no? -> Pass or fail ]
	- (refer to Section 6.3.2 - <a href="#section6-3-2">Test Features</a> just above)
	- (refer to Section 4 - <a href="#section4">Project Requirements</a>)
##### 6.3.3.2 - User Acceptance Test <a id="section6-3-3-2"></a>
- This testing verifies whether the primary purpose of the extension has been met or not – user satisfaction. 
- Testing would be with a variety of users with different systems and different technical experience; therefore, it will be simultaneous testing with performance/load, compatibility, and usability as well.
- Testers would be given a test script, telling them the premise of having downloaded a Google Chrome extension that says it has Bible verses appear on new tabs, but that it’s also very customizable.
  - (In part, they would be introduced with the premise that would theoretically exist on the Web Store description.) 
- I would request that they comment on their thoughts and experiences throughout the test, which I would record for further insight as I watched what they did and how.
- If they are having trouble, note that, and give them slight pushes towards important features.
	
- Testers would be asked for their thoughts about various elements of the extension after given ample time.
- This would outline all the basic test features intended for this extension.
  - Includes in and out-of-menu settings (17, 20), the menus themselves, the appeal of various preset options (14, 15), the light and dark modes (9, 18), the background image (3), the Bible verse window and settings regarding it (1, 4, 22, 7, 8, 6, 5, 19, 10), and so on.
  - (Additional test features would also be added accordingly.)
- It would also assess generalities regarding performance, usability, and overall aesthetics.
- The questionnaire would request a number on a satisfaction scale from 1 to 5, with 5 as most pleasing, for each of these.
  - (The goal is to have a 4 on average.)
  - There would also be a blank on the side to put ones specific qualitative reasoning.
- Their final overall experience will be graded on the same scale.
- There will be a section at the end for specific recommendations and changes to take into consideration.

## 7 - Test Results <a id="section7"></a>
Testing was performed according to the general guidelines laid out in the 6.3 - <a href="#section6-3">Testing Strategy</a> with 10 formal testers. (There was also an informal tester, but I only included their advised changes within the section below.) 
<br/>
### 7.1 - Advised Changes <a id="section7-1"></a>
(More details regarding these features and my plans for each can be found in 9 - <a href="#section9">Future Enhancements</a>.)<br/>
- Add more background images
- Ability to upload custom user background images
- Restore Google widgets and frequently used websites (that appear on normal new tabs)
- Ability to randomize Bible verse
- Add cursive and "feminine" fonts
- Categorize background images
- Font change preview (akin to MS Word)
- Ability to apply the Bible Verse *only* to the first tab opened
- Ability to randomly the background image with each tab opened
- Ability to open and have multiple verses for comparison
- Change 3-line menu button (make more obvious as a button to use, change it into an X to close)
- Ability to change verse header underline size/thickness
- Disable ability to select images when colors are active
### 7.2 - Test Reports <a id="section7-2"></a>
![](Quantitative_Graph.png)
<br/>
Overall usability scored 4.7/5.<br/>
Ease of navigation scored 4.8/5.<br/>
Performance scored 5/5.<br/>
Customizability scored 4.7/5.<br/>
Expected functionality scored 4.8/5.<br/>
Readability and aesthetics scored 4.8/5.<br/><br/>
Every category was rated with 4's or 5's, save for a single outlier (3) in Expected Functionality. This indicates that, despite having different computers, Chrome versions, experience with Chrome extensions, and experience with technology in general, all testers found the extension easy to navigate, perform well, readable, aesthetically pleasing, and very useable.<br/>The outlier (3) in functionality is because the user reported to not really have expectations of functionality, which is interesting since the premise of my testing survey explained what my extension's purpose was. Since no other users found issue with this survey question, I will consider this a mistake on how I asked the question rather than an issue on the part of my extension. In other words, I will consider the expectations of functionality for my extension well met.<br/><br/>
**Overall rating: 4.8/5**
<br/><br/>

![](Qualitative_Graph.png)
<br/>
When asked about what they liked most about the extension, 8/10 appreciated the options.<br/>
8/10 did not find any difficulty in using the extension. 2/10 were unfamiliar with Google Extensions.<br/>
10/10 liked the background images, with 3/10 including additional suggestions.<br/>
9/10 were satisfied by the font options. 1/10 wanted more feminine and/or cursive fonts (totally fair).<br/>
10/10 encountered no errors when using the extension.<br/>
5/10 gave feedback for additional functions to improve the extension. 5/10 said that there were no improvements needed.<br/>
9/10 users were able to customize the page to their liking.<br/>
10/10 users plan to keep using the extension.<br/>
9/10 users said they would suggest the extension to others.<br/>
10/10 gave positive feedback when asked to share their additional thoughts.<br/><br/>
From this, I know that I have largely satisfied the target audience for my extension with fully positive feedback. Although there were, of course, suggestions for additional functions to improve the extension, the fact that 5/10 testers were wholly satisfied and saw no need for major change - already able to customize the page to their liking - is an impressive feat for Bible Verse Vista in its initial release state. Furthermore, the fact that all of them are planning to continue using it is honestly gratifying and proves the success of my efforts. Also, the reason that 1/10 users did not say they would suggest the extension to others is because they simply didn't state whether they would or not (as opposed to them saying they wouldn't suggest it to others).<br/>
<br/>
**Overall, it is clear that well over 80% of users were greatly satisfied with Bible Verse Vista v1.0.0 in its release state. The ratings on the Chrome Web Store reflect this with 4.8/5 stars (from 4 reviews). I could not have asked for a better response to my first-time “real” and public creation in regard to programming. The positive response I’ve received and the potential for growth into a wider group of Christian believers inspires me to continue developing this extension, even years after I graduate.**
<br/><br/>

## 8 - Challenges Overcome <a id="section8"></a>
(NF???)
<br/>
(looking for it NOT being super easy, had to work hard, learned stuff in the process, show significant progress - not necessarily need a lot of detail, go through problems and how I had to stretch myself)
<br/>
(can itemize or write paragraphs with subheadings, maybe like each problem with a mini-paragraph?)
<br/><br/>

## 9 - Future Enhancements <a id="section9"></a>
Looking at the overall <a href="#section7">Test Results</a>, it was clear that the testers were very satisfied with Bible Verse Vista in its current state. Having asked for explanations on both my quantitative and qualitative questions, I compiled all suggestions made from them into the <a href="#section7-1">Advised Changes</a> section from earlier. While the list may seem long, only a couple of these features made any serious impact on the overall user perception of my extension. As such, my plans and reasoning for each suggested feature will be included here as part of this extension's future enhancements.
<br/><br/>
**Custom user background images**: (**mid priority, hard difficulty**)<br/>
&emsp;While it would be very easy to upload more background images, I believe that giving users the ability to upload their own images to use would more than satisfy their wishes. Simply adding more images would increase the size and impact the performance of my extension. Also, it's a feature that I wanted to include from the beginning of this project that was lost in the busy development schedule. It will be one of the next features that I will include in my next major update.
<br/><br/>
**Restore Google widgets and frequented websites**: (**high priority, unknown difficulty**)<br/>
&emsp;Unfortunately, this was a feature that I had entirely overlooked. For many years, I've used the DuckDuckGo browser extension, which removes all those things from my new tabs. However, testing showed that is one of the most significant missing features of my extension - to the point where the users missing them were willing to deactivate the extension to access them. Even though this was mentioned as a limited-time affair, I don't want to give any reason for my intended users to deactivate the extension. Thus, I also intend for this feature to be part of the next major update - if including those on my new tab is actually possible, that is.
 <br/><br/>
**Randomize Bible verse**: (**mid priority, mid difficulty**)<br/>
&emsp;This was another feature that I had intended in my original design for this extension. However, due to time constraints and difficult implementation within that time, I prioritized allowing the user to choose their own verse(s). Theoretically, a user could use an rng on their own and manually input whatever verse they get. However, I understand the desire for it as an official feature. This will not be a major priority though, as only one user in testing asked for it, and it's implementation is not expected to be easy.
 <br/><br/>
**Add cursive and "feminine" fonts**: (**low priority, easy difficulty**)<br/>
&emsp;This request is entirely fair and is not difficult to add. I will put this either in some minor update before the next major update, or rolled into that major update.
<br/><br/>
**Categorize background images**: (**low priority, easy difficulty**)<br/>
&emsp;This request is also fair, but I am unsure that there are enough backgrounds to justify categorization. There are just over 20 choices, and most of their titles are evocative and descriptive enough to tell what they are going to feature. In addition, I like the idea of allowing the user to browse and discover what they like the best based on those titles and their personal curiousity. I may not actually implement this feature at all, but I will consider it based on my own testing and/or if more user feedback for it arises.
 <br/><br/>
**Font change preview (akin to MS Word)**: (**low priority, hard difficulty**)<br/>
&emsp;This sounds like a nice and convenient feature that I would like myself. However, there are some possible issues that may prevent its inclusion. It would likely take considerable reworking of the program to implment it, so it has a lower priority.
<br/><br/>
**Apply Bible Verse *only* to the first tab opened**: (**low priority, mid difficulty**)<br/>
&emsp;This feature sounds very strange to me, but it's important to note that this was suggested by the same person whose Google widgets were not included on my new tab page. If I can reinclude those widgets, then I don't believe that this odd feature would be a priority for them. Only if there is actually no way to do so, then I would consider adding this as an option.
<br/><br/>
**Randomize background image with each tab opened**: (**mid priority, low difficulty**)<br/>
&emsp;This feature makes more sense to add, and I don't believe it would be too hard to implement either. This could be added in a minor update, but it doesn't have too high of a priority.
<br/><br/>
**Ability to open and have multiple verses for comparison**: (**low priority, mid difficulty**)<br/>
&emsp;While this feature could be neat, verse comparison is not the primary purpose of my extension. I believe that there would be better websites and extensions out there primarily for that purpose. However, I could consider adding this in the further future. Of course, with more support, I would implement it sooner.
<br/><br/>
**Change 3-line menu button**: (**low priority, low difficulty**)<br/>
&emsp;This was an interesting request. A couple users were unfamiliar with the 3-line button (I hate "hamburger button" with a vengeance) as a way to open and close menus. Early in my extensions design, having this be the menu button was an intentional choice so that I could avoid putting words on the screen like "Menu" or "Open Menu". Doing so would have made it obvious, but it also goes against the entire point of focusing in on the words of the verse(s). I also made the button light grey and on lowered opacity such that it would blend with any background but still be visible. I could only see myself slightly raising its opacity. In addition, I could also include an "X" button as an additional way to close the menu.
<br/><br/>
**Ability to change verse header underline size/thickness**: (**low priority, low difficulty**)<br/>
&emsp;This addition would be very easy to implement in my extension, and I can certainly have it within the next minor or major update.
<br/><br/>
**Disable ability to select images when colors are active**: (**low priority, hard difficulty**)<br/>
&emsp;This was requested as a way to make what is able and what is *not* able to be done more obvious to users. While it is a common-sense thing to implement, I have had difficulty in programming similar features to it in my extension. In addition, no other users during testing pointed it out as an issue for them. Also, personally, I like to be able to change the image, even when I'm not able to see it yet. Unless users point this out as an issue in the future, I may not implement this in my extension.
