## 1 - Statement of Purpose/Problem Statement <a id="section1"></a>
Today, Christians have the opportunity to deliver the Word in a more effective, convenient, and personalized way with modern technologies, such as Google Chrome extensions. However, the majority of existing Bible verse extensions often fall short of expectations due to outdated browsers, generic backgrounds, lack of Biblical versions, and lack of customization options. This ultimately results in a clunky and unsatisfactory user experience. The key solution to this issue is to provide users with greater customizability in a variety of fields. Doing this will give Christians a more satisfying and immersive experience with Scripture, resulting in better engagement and understanding overall. This project seeks to create a superior Bible verse extension for Google Chrome, allowing fellow Christians to move forward with modern opportunities to spread the Word effectively.
<br/><br/>

## 2 - Research and Background <a id="section2"></a>
(NF???)
(all the things I needed to figure out – describing what I had to learn / what would you need to learn PRIOR to understanding how project works or how to make project)
<br/>
(just do my best to recall)
<br/>
(varied length could be 1 page, could be 3-4 pages)
<br/>

### 2.1 - (any subsections needed???) <a id="section2-1"></a>
(???)
<br/><br/>

## 3 - Project Languages, Software, and Hardware <a id="section3"></a>
Project Languages:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

Software: Google Chrome v122.0.6261.129 (latest)
<br/>
Hardware: runs on any computer that can run the latest version of Google Chrome

<p>
ID Number: 1
</p>
<p>
Type: Functional
</p>
<p>
Description:<br/>
&emsp; The extension will display a Bible verse on the new tab page. This will be implemented from the website Bible Gateway. 
</p>
<p>
Rationale:<br/>
&emsp; This is the main functionality of the extension, and it will serve the purpose of providing the user with a Bible verse.
</p>
<p>
Fit Criterion:<br/>
&emsp; A Bible verse is displayed on the new tab page - yes or no.
</p>
<p>
Priority: 1

----

<p>
ID Number: 2
</p>
<p>
Type: Functional
</p>
<p>
Description:<br/>
&emsp; The extension's search bar will sync with their default browser. 
</p>
<p>
Rationale:<br/>
&emsp; There are Google extensions that allow for the use of a different search engine while within Google Chrome (i.e. Duckduckgo). Maintaining this user preference will increase the extension's appeal. Not providing this feature would be a downgrade in the minds of a significant number of users. 
</p>
<p>
Fit Criterion:<br/>
&emsp; Users can choose their preferred browser for the search bar in an options menu.
</p>
<p>
Priority: 2

ID Number: 3
</p>
<p>
Type: Functional
</p>
<p>
Description:<br/>
&emsp; The extension will allow users to choose their own background image or style. 
</p>
<p>
Rationale:<br/>
&emsp; Customization is a key aspect of the extension, and allowing users to choose their own background image or style will make the extension more personal. 
</p>
<p>
Fit Criterion:<br/>
&emsp; Users can choose their own background image or style in an options menu.

Description:<br/>
&emsp; The extension will allow users to choose the location of the verse window on the new tab page. 
</p>
<p>
Rationale:<br/>
&emsp; Customization is a key aspect of the extension, and allowing users to choose the location of the verse window will make the extension more personal.

<p>
Description:<br/>
&emsp; The extension will allow users to choose their preferred version of the Bible. 
</p>
<p>
Rationale:<br/>
&emsp; Customization is a key aspect of the extension, and users may have a preferred version of the Bible to read. Giving them the option to choose it will increase the extension's appeal.
</p>
<p>
Fit Criterion:<br/>
&emsp; Users can choose their preferred Bible version in an options menu.
</p>

<p>
ID Number: 6
</p>
<p>
Type: Functional
</p>
<p>
Description:<br/>
&emsp; The extension will display the "Verse of the Day" from Bible Gateway by default. 
</p>
<p>
Rationale:<br/>
&emsp; Displaying the "Verse of the Day" will provide users with a daily Bible verse without requiring any action on their part. This will allow for users to reflect upon the same verses as others, read verses relevant to the Christian calendar, and generally aid those lacking motivation or technical literacy to select the verses themselves.
</p>
<p>
Fit Criterion:<br/>
&emsp; The "Verse of the Day" is displayed by default as the Bible verse on the new tab page. 
</p>
<p>
Priority: 1

----

<p>
ID Number: 7
</p>
<p>
Type: Functional
</p>
<p>
Description:<br/>
&emsp; The extension will allow users to choose a random Bible verse to display on the new tab page. To clarify, this random verse would be cycled daily, not any time a new tab is opened. This selection will also be purely random, even allowing repeated verses on consecutive days. All of Scripture is God's Word.
</p>
<p>
Rationale:<br/>
&emsp; Allowing users to receive a random Bible verse will provide them with an alternative series of verses throughout their use of the extension. Some users may prefer this in reading their Scripture.
</p>
<p>
Fit Criterion:<br/>
&emsp; Users can choose for a random Bible verse to display on the new tab page in an options menu. 
</p>
<p>
Priority: 3

ID Number: 8
</p>
<p>
Type: Functional
</p>
<p>
Description:<br/>
&emsp; The extension will allow users to choose their own custom verse to display on the new tab page. 
</p>
<p>
Rationale:<br/>
&emsp; Allowing users to choose their own custom verse will provide them with a personalized experience and may be useful for memorization or meditation and study. 
</p>
<p>
Fit Criterion:<br/>
&emsp; Users can choose their own custom verse to display on the new tab page in an options menu. This will be the primary alternate choice of Bible verse.

<p>
ID Number: 9
</p>
<p>
Type: Look and Feel - Appearance
</p>
<p>
Description:<br/>
&emsp; The extension's default background on the new tab page will be minimalistic with a light or dark mode.
</p>
<p>
Rationale:<br/>
&emsp; A minimalistic background will provide a clean and unobtrusive look for the extension, while the light/dark option will accentuate that look depending on which a user prefers. In addition, allowing users to choose between the two will allow for a simple binary choice and a clean canvas for those seeking more customization.
  
   if they rate the presentation on scale of 1 to 5, with 5 as most pleasing, it is 4 or above
</p>
<p>
Fit Criterion:<br/>
&emsp; The default background will be minimalistic, and there will be an option for light or dark mode in an options menu. Whether these backgrounds are suitable will be decided by survey. It will be accepted if surveyors, on a scale of 1 to 5, rate it a 4 on average.

</p>
<p>
Description:<br/>
&emsp; The extension will allow users to easily share Bible verses via social media.
</p>
<p>
Rationale:<br/>
&emsp; Sharing Bible verses is a common practice among Christians, and social media is a popular platform for doing so.
</p>
<p>
Fit Criterion:<br/>
&emsp; The user should be able to share a Bible verse to their social media account with a few clicks.

Type: Performance - Speed and Latency
</p>
<p>
Description:<br/>
&emsp; The extension will load very quickly and not slow down the user's browsing experience.
</p>
<p>
Rationale:<br/>
&emsp; Users expect extensions to load quickly and not interfere with their browsing experience. 
</p>
<p>
Fit Criterion:<br/>
&emsp; The extension should load within 100 milliseconds (1/10 of a second) of the user opening a new tab. (This is under the assumption that the user has selected an extremely high definition background.)

</p>
<p>
Description:<br/>
&emsp; The extension will have clear and easy-to-understand instructions for use.
</p>
<p>
Rationale:<br/>
&emsp; Users need clear instructions to make the most of the extension's features. This especially the case for users that may not be technically literate.
</p>
<p>
Fit Criterion:<br/>
&emsp; The instructions should be concise and easy to understand, with no technical jargon or assumed knowledge.

<p>
Type: Performance - Reliability and Availability
</p>
<p>
Description:<br/>
&emsp; The extension will be lightweight and not consume excessive system resources. 
</p>
<p>
Rationale:<br/>
&emsp; Users expect extensions to be lightweight and not consume too much memory or CPU resources. Google Chrome, even with a single tab open, consumes a large amount of memory. Making the extension casually useable is almost as important making it functional.
</p>
<p>
Fit Criterion:<br/>
&emsp; : The extension should consume less than 50 MB of memory and less than 0.3% of the CPU resources when in use.

</p>
<p>
Rationale:<br/>
&emsp; Consistent visual design helps create a more professional and polished user experience. 
</p>
<p>
Fit Criterion:<br/>
&emsp; Whether the basic visual design is cohesive will be decided by survey. It will be accepted if surveyors, on a scale of 1 to 5, rate it a 4 on average.

Type: Look and Feel - Appearance
</p>
<p>
Description:<br/>
&emsp; The extension will provide some basic, high-quality background images for users to choose from. 
</p>
<p>
Rationale:<br/>
&emsp; The background image is a key visual element of the extension, and high-quality images can enhance the user experience. Supplying them will be helpful for those wishing to test the extension's features or are not technically literate enough to insert their own.
</p>
<p>
Fit Criterion:<br/>
&emsp; The user should be able to choose from a variety of high quality background images.

</p>
<p>
Description:<br/>
&emsp; The extension will not cause any errors or crashes in the browser. 
</p>
<p>
Rationale:<br/>
&emsp; Rationale: Extension errors or crashes can disrupt both the user's Scripture and browsing experience and cause frustration.
</p>
<p>
Fit Criterion:<br/>
&emsp; The extension will be tested thoroughly - at least 50 times - to ensure it does not cause any errors or crashes in the browser.

Description:<br/>
&emsp; The extension will implement minimal menus on the new tab. Instead, the majority of menus will be present in the page of the extension itself (as seen in the top of Google Chrome, in the Extensions section).
</p>
<p>
Rationale:<br/>
&emsp; Users may find visual elements such as extensive customizing menus as distracting or unnecessary. At the same time, these menus will still remain at short reach while in the Extensions section.
</p>
<p>
Fit Criterion:<br/>
&emsp; The user menus will mostly be implemented in the extension page rather than on a new tab.

<p>
Description:<br/>
&emsp; The extension will support light and dark mode for the verse window. 
</p>
<p>
Rationale:<br/>
&emsp; Allowing differing light or dark mode settings may seem strange. However, allowing the option to have it be different allows for those who may want it an improved user experience. It may help a user focus in on the verse with the contrast in color.
</p>
<p>
Fit Criterion:<br/>
&emsp; The user can set one or both the background and verse window to be light or dark mode.

</p>
<p>
Rationale:<br/>
&emsp; Allowing users that speak other languages than English to receive God’s Word is important. However, I will focus more on the functionality, customization, and usability of the extension.
</p>
<p>
Fit Criterion:<br/>
&emsp; The extension will have at least five different languages available, and the language change will be seamless and immediate.

</p>
<p>
Rationale:<br/>
&emsp; As this extension is created for the sake of greater customization in Bible verse displays, it should be expected that some users will customize far more heavily than others. 
</p>
<p>

<p>
Rationale:<br/>
&emsp; All modern applications should expect to be updated in the future. Therefore, it should be built to do so from the beginning to allow for easier and faster updates for users.

#### 6.1.1 - Project Overview <a id="section6-1-1"></a>
This document outlines the testing strategy and approach for the development of this Google Chrome extension that creates highly customizable new tabs to display Bible verses. While a number of extensions exist that display verses on new tabs, many are extremely bland and static, lacking any customization options. This extension aims to create a more effective, convenient, and personalized way to deliver the Word to any user.
#### 6.1.2 - Goals/Objectives <a id="section6-1-2"></a>
- Validate the functionality and customization options of the Bible verses and the New Tab for the extension
- Ensure extension compatibility within the Chrome browser framework
- Ensure that the extension and its customization is satisfying and easy-to-use, receiving feedback from a variety of users
- Measure and minimize load for best performance – stability even with a large number of new tabs
#### 6.1.3 - Constraints <a id="section6-1-3"></a>
-	There was a limited time to work before milestones and due dates, including the final submission.
-	This was a one-man project – I am the only developer and test manager.
-	I have had multiple ongoing courses with weekly projects of their own, which required split attention with this project.
-	Due to critical issues regarding my usual workspace, I had to work within a limited environment on another laptop. This negatively affected the development and testing time. Thankfully, this would soon even out as the system become more aclimated to my workload.

### 6.3 - Testing Strategy <a id="section6-3"></a>
#### 6.3.1 - Test Items <a id="section6-3-1"></a>
- Bible Verse Vista v1.0.0.0
- Google Chrome v122.0.6261.129 (latest version)
- User questionnaire (UAT)
#### 6.3.2 - Test Features <a id="section6-3-2"></a>
(NF???)
<br/>
(Update and insert to those ACTUALLY present and being tested)
#### 6.3.3 - Test Approach <a id="section6-3-3"></a>
-	My overall approach to testing was primarily manual testing. The presets, user settings, and the Bible Gateway sync were easy to test. The many other customization features were testing extremes, many of which were often be implemented on purpose and allowed for the sake of user customization. (Regardless of aesthetic appeal or “normal” sensibility – user choice is the priority.)
  -	As the sole developer, all the extensive testing performed by myself was white box testing.
  -	As for anyone else tested, they performed black box testing. This approximated how users would receive it from the Chrome Web Store, testing whether the extension itself was intuitive enough to use effectively.
-	There was no plan for automatic testing.
-	The types of tests that were performed are unit tests, integration tests, system tests, and user acceptance tests (UATs).
##### 6.3.3.1 - System Test <a id="section6-3-3-1"></a>
-	This testing ensured that Bible Gateway was synced properly and that each customization setting within a new tab was properly implemented – default, other presets, and user-chosen – in an individual sense and all together.
-	It also verified if the settings are maintained across many new tabs and tests whether settings save or not upon webpage refresh, extension on/off, browser on/off, post-shutdown, etc.
-	Is it displaying each and all of the features as expected? 
  -	[ Yes or no? -> Pass or fail ]
  -	(NF???)
	- (refer to Section 6.3.2 - <a href="#section6-3-2">Test Features</a> just above)
	- (refer to Section 4 - <a href="#section4">Project Requirements</a>, IDs 1-24)
##### 6.3.3.2 - User Acceptance Test <a id="section6-3-3-2"></a>
- This testing verifies whether the primary purpose of the extension has been met or not – user satisfaction. 
- Testing would be with a variety of users with different systems and different technical experience; therefore, it will be simultaneous testing with performance/load, compatibility, and usability as well.
- Testers would be given a test script, telling them the premise of having downloaded a Google Chrome extension that says it has Bible verses appear on new tabs, but that it’s also very customizable.
  - (In part, they would be introduced with the premise that would theoretically exist on the Web Store description.) 
- I would request that they comment on their thoughts and experiences throughout the test, which I would record for further insight as I watched what they did and how.
- If they are having trouble, note that, and give them slight pushes towards important features.
	
- Testers would be asked for their thoughts about various elements of the extension after given ample time.
- This would outline all the basic test features intended for this extension.
  - Includes in and out-of-menu settings (17, 20), the menus themselves, the appeal of various preset options (14, 15), the light and dark modes (9, 18), the background image (3), the Bible verse window and settings regarding it (1, 4, 22, 7, 8, 6, 5, 19, 10), and so on.
  - (Additional test features would also be added accordingly.)
- It would also assess generalities regarding performance, usability, and overall aesthetics.
- The questionnaire would request a number on a satisfaction scale from 1 to 5, with 5 as most pleasing, for each of these.
  - (The goal is to have a 4 on average.)
  - There would also be a blank on the side to put ones specific qualitative reasoning.
- Their final overall experience will be graded on the same scale.
- There will be a section at the end for specific recommendations and changes to take into consideration.

<br/><br/>

## 9 - Future Enhancements <a id="section9"></a>
(NF???)
<br/>
(have an intro paragraph for a header, likely reflecting on test results (advised changes and test reports) )
<br/>
